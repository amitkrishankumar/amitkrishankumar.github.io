  <p> Dr. Amit Krishan Kumar's research interests are rooted in the fascinating intersections of <b> quantum inpired approaches and theories, higher dimensional research, 
  fascinating healing capabilities of human body, and mathematical models </b>. He is deeply motivated by the quest to develop mathematical models that offer a deeper understanding
  of quantum phenomena, human physiology, and the nature of consciousness. Dr. Kumar envisions a future where we can solve the measurement problem, mathematically represent the etheric body, 
  engineer optimal health, and reconfigure the frequencies of air and water to enhance well-being. He passionately believes, <em> ‘As long as you are breathing, you can bring about the desired change’</em>. <p>
  </p> The profound observation that  <em>"we breathe in as soon as we are born and breathe out just before death, with all our breathing in between a matter of management"</em> fuels his dedication to exploring
  the respiratory system. This deep curiosity drives his exploration of how breath connects to our overall health, consciousness, and the very fabric of reality. Dr. Kumar's work embodies a bold and visionary approach,
  aiming to unravel the mysteries of life and unlock new pathways for healing and transformation. </p>

  <p> Amit Krishan Kumar's research interests encompass a wide range of fields, including pattern recognition, cymatics, dream psychology, electrical-electronics engineering and design,
  and the entanglement of quantum multimodal states. He is also deeply engaged in exploring the laws of higher-dimensional and reversible universes, as well as developing mathematical
  models of the human body that focus on disease identification and biochemical systems theory. His work in quantum theory addresses key challenges such as the measurement problem, the 
  <em>N</em>-body problem, and the application of imaginary order calculus </p>
  <p> His innovative approach integrates advanced mathematical techniques, including fractional calculus, calculus of variations, and game theory, to enhance control science engineering, 
    optimization, clustering, and classification. His primary focus is on applying AI-based optimal solutions to pattern recognition, utilizing both supervised and unsupervised learning 
    methods. He also explores practical applications in computer vision, especially for improving road safety, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. </p> 
  <p> In the realms of cymatics and human body systems, he employs machine learning, signal processing, risk analysis, and clinical decision support systems (CDSS). His research involves 
    human systems modeling, time symmetry, bimodal systems, and numerical analysis. His work is specifically applied to areas such as respiration, water purification, quantum gravity, 
    air purification, consciousness modeling, etheric body models, and the cymatics of <em>N</em>-dimensional sounds. Through this multidisciplinary approach, he aims to gain deeper insights 
    into the fundamental nature of reality and develop innovative solutions to enhance human health and well-being. </p>

  <p> The research questions are; 1) does disease enter a subtle body like vital-breath body before showing symptoms to the physical body; 2) can healing of the etheric elements 
    heal the incurable; how does the breathing patterns, breathing techniques, respiratory disease, and respiratory flow help in modelling the etheric body.  Coronavirus disease 
    targets the lungs. Quantum-inspired approach to bimodal data especially the very unique quantum entanglement, provides answers to many questions especially when considering 
    immeasurable quantities. The quantum-inspired algorithm goes deeper and applies the fantastic laws of the quantum world to data science where it links the objective truth with
    the subjective and the dimensional truth for different frames of reference. </p>
