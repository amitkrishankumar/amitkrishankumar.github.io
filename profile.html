  <p> Dr. Amit Krishan Kumar's research interests are rooted in the fascinating intersections of <b> quantum inpired approaches and theories, higher dimensional research, 
  fascinating healing capabilities of human body, and mathematical models </b>. He is deeply motivated by the quest to develop mathematical models that offer a deeper understanding
  of quantum phenomena, human physiology, and the nature of consciousness. Dr. Kumar envisions a future where we can solve the measurement problem, mathematically represent the etheric body, 
  engineer optimal health, and reconfigure the frequencies of air and water to enhance well-being. He passionately believes, <em> ‘As long as you are breathing, you can bring about the desired change’</em>. <p>
  </p> The profound observation that  <em>"we breathe in as soon as we are born and breathe out just before death, with all our breathing in between a matter of management"</em> fuels his dedication to exploring
  the respiratory system. This deep curiosity drives his exploration of how breath connects to our overall health, consciousness, and the very fabric of reality. Dr. Kumar's work embodies a bold and visionary approach,
  aiming to unravel the mysteries of life and unlock new pathways for healing and transformation. </p>

  <p> Specific research interest include pattern recognition, cymatics, dream psychology, electrical-electronics engerring and design, entanglement of quantum multimodal states,
    laws of higher dimensional universe, mathematical models of human body system, disease identification, and biochemical systems theory, quantum theory including measurement 
    problem, <em>N</em>-Body problem, and imaginary order calculus, fractional calculus, calculus of variation and game theory for control science engineering, optimisation, 
    clustering, and classification, application of AI based optimal solutions of puzzles to pattern recognition namely supervised and unsupervised learning, computer vision 
    for road safety, health care, and environment monitoring, machine learning, signal processing, numerical analysis applied to respiration, water purification, quantum gravity,
    air purification, consciousness modelling, etheric body models, and cymatics of <em>N</em>-dimensional sounds, risk analysis, clinical decision support system (CDSS), human systems model,

  <p> The research questions are; 1) does disease enter a subtle body like vital-breath body before showing symptoms to the physical body; 2) can healing of the etheric elements 
    heal the incurable; how does the breathing patterns, breathing techniques, respiratory disease, and respiratory flow help in modelling the etheric body.  Coronavirus disease 
    targets the lungs. Quantum-inspired approach to bimodal data especially the very unique quantum entanglement, provides answers to many questions especially when considering 
    immeasurable quantities. The quantum-inspired algorithm goes deeper and applies the fantastic laws of the quantum world to data science where it links the objective truth with
    the subjective and the dimensional truth for different frames of reference. </p>
