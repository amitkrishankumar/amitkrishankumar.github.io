            <b>Motivation and Theories</b>
  <p> Intriguing research which motivate Amit Krishan Kumar are <b> quantum theories, higher dimensional research, health care, and math </b> <em> Served up by our friendly team, every day of the week, our mouthwatering Sunday roast and weekday carvery are sure to be a hit with all the family. </em></p> This dissertation inspires and motivates many things. Firstly it encourages research on
ancient yogic breathing techniques like pranayama which is one of the key motivation for
studying respiratory systems. Furthermore it is anticipated that carefully guided ancient yo-
gic breathing techniques could provide ground breaking results and therapy for incurable
respiratory ailments. The research question in this research are; 1)does disease enter a subtle
body like vital-breath body (prana body) before showing symptoms to the physical body; 2)
can healing of the prana body via pranayam heal the incurable; how does the breathing pat-
terns, breathing techniques, respiratory disease, and respiratory flow help in modelling the
prana sharir (body). Moreover, the fact of the statement, ‘we breathe in as soon as we are
born and breathe out just before death, in between we manage the breathing’, motivates
deep research on the respiratory system. Coronavirus disease targets the lungs. The outbreak
of the coronavirus which resulted in a world pandemic during the course of this study also
motivates this research. The most commonly observed problem in remote care during the
outbreak was false alerts in health care. Considering the mass number of populations being
affected on daily basis, require a system where correct health status and relevant health care
could be provided. Optimising decision making in clinical decision support could reduce

alert fatigue.
Quantum-inspired approach to bimodal data especially the very unique quantum en-
tanglement, provides answers to many questions especially when considering immeasurable
quantities. The quantum-inspired algorithm goes deeper and applies the fantastic laws of the
quantum world to data science where it links the objective truth with the subjective and the
dimensional truth for different frames of reference. The bimodal data is considered based on
a unique dissertation on hand gestures entitled ‘Real time hand gesture recognition system’
which states that bimodal data could provide many unknowns. The research is the first to use
two separate independent modes in hand gesture application. The first intention of the work
was to work with any two-mode of data. By observing a Rubik cube and realising that it can
be regarded as a two-mode three cluster puzzle, the number of classes is chosen as 3. The
unique properties of Rubik cubes and the amazing world of quantum entanglement inspire this
work based on clustering to adapt to the entanglement and puzzle-based techniques. There
are robust solutions available for many complex problems which need to be applied to solve
some engineering problems. The Gods number is one of the robust solutions achieved by
experimenting with many techniques but has not been applied to any engineering problems.
The Rubik cube God’s number is a major motivation. It is being applied to respiratory data
in this research to reduce alert fatigue. The approach can be used to solve for many problems
in a bimodal tri-class system.
The interesting concepts of fluid mechanics and the increasing research interest in sci-
entific machine learning like physics-informed neural network (PINN) could be combined
together to design solutions for respiratory diseases like pulmonary fibrosis. PINN has not
yet been applied to model a respiratory disease. The works on PINN captivate the attention
of the research inspiring it to be applied to the respiratory system for the first time. In this
thesis, the respiratory flow based on some pranayama techniques is studied and modelled to
evaluate respiratory impedance. The respiratory impedance, the predicted respiratory rate,
and other features are then used to cluster into 3 classes. The existing solutions like God′s
number and entanglement are combined with robust approximation techniques to minimise
alert fatigue in clinical decision support system for people with respiratory disease.
