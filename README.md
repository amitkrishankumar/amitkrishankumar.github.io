  <p> Intriguing research which inspires and motivates Amit Krishan Kumar are <b> quantum inpired approaches and theories, higher dimensional research, fascinating healing capabilities of human body, and mathematical models </b>. Amit Krishan Kumar believes that it is possible to find solution to the measurement problem, mathematically model the etheric body, create the desired health, and reconfigure the air and water frequency for optimal health. <em> ‘As long as you are breathing, you can bring about the desired change’. Moreover, the fact of the statement, ‘we breathe in as soon as we are born and breathe out just before death, in between we manage the breathing’, motivates deep research on the respiratory system.  </em> </p>

  <p> The research questions are; 1) does disease enter a subtle body like vital-breath body before showing symptoms to the physical body; 2) can healing of the etheric elements heal the incurable; how does the breathing patterns, breathing techniques, respiratory disease, and respiratory flow help in modelling the etheric body.  Coronavirus disease targets the lungs. Quantum-inspired approach to bimodal data especially the very unique quantum entanglement, provides answers to many questions especially when considering immeasurable quantities. The quantum-inspired algorithm goes deeper and applies the fantastic laws of the quantum world to data science where it links the objective truth with the subjective and the dimensional truth for different frames of reference. </p>
