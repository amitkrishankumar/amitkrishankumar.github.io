  <p> Intriguing research that inspires and motivates Dr. Amit Krishan Kumar are <b> quantum-inspired approaches and theories, higher dimensional research, fascinating healing capabilities of the human body, and mathematical models for a deeper understanding of the quantum world, the human body functions, and consciousness </b>. Amit Krishan Kumar believes that it is possible to find the solution to the measurement problem, mathematically model the etheric body, create the desired health, and reconfigure the air and water frequency for optimal health. <em> ‘As long as you are breathing, you can bring about the desired change’. Moreover, the fact of the statement, ‘we breathe in as soon as we are born and breathe out just before death, in between we manage the breathing’</em>, motivates deep research on the respiratory system. </p>

  <p> His specific research interests include pattern recognition, cymatics, dream psychology, electrical-electronics engineering and design, entanglement of quantum multimodal states, laws of higher dimensional universe, mathematical models of the human body system which includes disease identification and biochemical systems theory, and quantum theory including the measurement problem, <em>N</em>-Body problem, and imaginary order calculus. His models and approach entail fractional calculus, calculus of variation, and game theory for control science engineering, optimisation, clustering, and classification. His work is mainly concerned with the application of AI-based optimal solutions of puzzles to pattern recognition namely supervised and unsupervised learning, computer vision for road safety, health care, and environment monitoring. His works related to cymatics and human body systems applies machine learning, signal processing, risk analysis, clinical decision support system (CDSS), human systems model, time-symmetry, bimodal systems, and numerical analysis that is applied specifically for respiration, water purification, quantum gravity, air purification, consciousness modelling, etheric body models, and cymatics of <em>N</em>-dimensional sounds. </p>

  <p> The research questions related to his work are; * Does disease enter a subtle body like vital-breath body before showing symptoms to the physical body; * Will healing of the etheric elements heal the incurable; *How does the breathing patterns, breathing techniques, respiratory disease, and respiratory flow help in modelling the etheric body; *Is the curvature of space-time isochronous for entangled particles. Quantum-inspired approach to bimodal data especially the very unique quantum entanglement, provides answers to many questions especially when considering immeasurable quantities. The quantum-inspired algorithm goes deeper and applies the fantastic laws of the quantum world to data science where it links the objective truth with the subjective and the dimensional truth for different frames of reference. Some of his theories are; switch of dimensions by entangled particles, infinite womb theory, and relative truth governed by subject-object communication leading to wave-particle collapse.</p>
